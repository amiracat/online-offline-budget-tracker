Head over to the app on [Heroku](http://budget-tracker-121212.herokuapp.com/) and start tracking your budget. You can add expenses and deposits. The functionality works online and offline, ensuring that your account balance is up-to-date and accurate while traveling.

When the network is offline, you can see in this console screenshot that "save record invoked" is saving your work:
